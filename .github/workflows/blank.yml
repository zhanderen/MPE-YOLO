This paper proposes an enhanced model based on YOLOv8, named MPE-YOLO. To begin with, a multilevel feature integrator (MFI) module is employed to enhance the representation of small target features, meticulously mitigating information loss during the feature fusion process. For the backbone network of the model, a perception enhancement convolution (PEC) module is introduced to replace traditional convolutional layers, thereby expanding the network’s fine-grained feature processing capability. Furthermore, an enhanced scope-C2f (ES-C2f) module is designed, utilizing channel expansion and stacking of multiscale convolutional kernels to improve the network’s ability to capture small target details. Through a series of experiments on the VisDrone, RSOD, and AI-TOD datasets, the model has demonstrated superior performance in aerial image detection tasks compared to existing advanced algorithms, while also achieving a lightweight model structure. The experimental results prove the potential of MPE-YOLO in enhancing the accuracy and operational efficiency of aerial target detection.
Codes will coming soon.
