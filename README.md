MPE-YOLO based on yolov8.
a multilevel feature integrator (MFI) module is employed to enhance the representation of small target features, which meticulously moderates information loss during the feature fusion process. 
For the backbone network of the model, a perception enhancement convolution (PEC) module is introduced to replace traditional convolutional layers, thereby expanding the network’s fine-grained feature processing capability. 
Furthermore, an enhanced scope-C2f (ES-C2f) module is designed, utilizing channel expansion and stacking of multiscale convolutional kernels to enhance the network’s ability to capture small target details. 
After a series of experiments on the VisDrone, RSOD, and AI-TOD datasets, the model has not only demonstrated superior performance in aerial image detection tasks compared to existing advanced algorithms but also achieved a lightweight model structure. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of MPE-YOLO in enhancing the accuracy and operational efficiency of aerial target detection. 
The code will be gradually released after the manuscript is accepted.
The network connection is too poor, and I often can't access GitHub. I'll continue once I find a reliable VPN.
